# SMS Spam Detection - AI Application

## Overview
This project is an AI-based SMS Spam Detection application that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using a Machine Learning model. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, deployment of an API using Flask, and hosting on **Render** for live access.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Text data cleaning and feature extraction
- **Model Training**: Traditional ML model (Logistic Regression)
- **Web API**: Flask-based API for spam detection
- **User Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for message classification
- **Deployment**: Hosted on **Render** for online accessibility

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation & Model Training

### Steps Performed:
1. **Dataset Used**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
2. **Preprocessing**: Removed stopwords, tokenized text, converted text to vectors using TF-IDF.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Used **Logistic Regression** for classification.
   - Split dataset into training & testing.
   - Achieved good accuracy with optimized hyperparameters.
4. **Saving the Model**:
   - Saved trained **model** as `spam_model.pkl`.
   - Saved **TF-IDF Vectorizer** as `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating API using Flask

### Steps Performed:
1. **Created a Flask Application** (`app.py`)
   - Loads the model and vectorizer.
   - Accepts input from users.
   - Predicts whether a message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
2. **Tested API using Postman**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend - Web Interface

### Steps Performed:
1. **Created `index.html`**
   - User-friendly **form to input messages**.
   - Displays output **in color-coded format** (Spam - Red, Not Spam - Green).
2. **Updated `app.py`**
   - Added `render_template` for displaying results dynamically.

---
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment on Render

### Steps Performed:
1. **Pushed code to GitHub**
   - Used `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`, `git push origin main`
2. **Created a Render Web Service**
   - Connected GitHub repo to Render.
   - It will create a workspace and the dashboard will look like this:
     ![Dashboard](https://github.com/Kritika-saha/Projects-advance-analytics/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot%202025-03-30%20222455.png)
   - If we click on webs services we can select the directory where our files are present and click on Deploy.
   - It will deploy and build the API successfully.
3. **Tested API on Render using Postman**
   - Screenshot of **Render API Test in Postman**:
